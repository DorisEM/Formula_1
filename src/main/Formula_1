Formula 1 team manager, by Taki. Revised by Korn√©l.

You are the new Manager of the CodeCool F1 team and tasked with modeling and implementing a system that calculates the total profit of it.

The team has cars, car parts, and employees. Cars are made out of car parts.

The employees are drivers, pit crew members, and engineers. Cars have a driver, but the driver can change between races.

The employees have a name, and an age. The Drivers have an experience (Beginner, Medium, and Expert), all drivers get their payments based on their experience:
Beginners get 20.000 EUR, Medium drivers 40.000 EUR, Expert drivers 100.000 EUR for each race they participate in. The other employees have a daily payment of 1.000 EUR

Every race, 2 car parts get used up per car, so you need to buy new ones. Each part costs 10.000 EUR

In a year, there are 22 races. On average, your team seems to win 2 races each year and come second in 5. Wins are worth 10.000.000 EUR, while coming second are worth 1.000.000 EUR.

Given an F1 team with 2 cars, 3 drivers (one for each experience level), 4 pit crew members, and 2 engineers, how much profit is your team gonna make in an average year?
